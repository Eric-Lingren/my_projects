                    Aesthetic Facial Treatments are created exclusively for physicians and licensed professionals.
                    We use products with the newest technology that maximize visible results. Healing colloidal
                    minerals, antioxidants, peptides, and plant stem cells work effectively with skin cells. Benefits
                    are smoother, radiant, and healthy skin.
                    Collagen Induction Therapy is an innovative treatment for fine lines, scars, and skin texture.
                    Tiny needles are used to stimulate the skin by producing collagen, elastin, and tiny
                    microchannels. The procedure allows serums and stem cells to be absorbed effectively, further
                    enhancing their effect into deeper layers of the skin.
                    Peptide Mask includes advanced ingredients of peptides and plant stem cells. This cooling gel
                    mask calms and soothes stressed skin. This is a perfect treatment to complete CIT (Collagen
                    Induction Therapy). Clients report a brighter, glowing complexion after treatment.
                    Vita Brite Refreshing Facial is a classic treatment because it’s versatile and effective. Results
                    are typically immediate with healthier, brighter, more radiant skin. This enzyme facial is a
                    favorite because it’s safe for all skin types, men, teenagers, and pregnant women. It’s an
                    excellent first step for chemical peels.
